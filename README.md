# IEM-BP-Desktop-Software
This is a Java blood pressure software, matching the hardwares of I.E.M GmbH(Germany). 
This software achieves remote telemedicine. doctors only need to wear the device for patients, and import data into the software after blood pressure measurement. The software would generate diagnosis report automaticly and generate conclusion and suggestion. The result and patients information would be uploaded to cloud database of big hospital, where doctors only need to check the result and confirm. Then this report would be valid and all diagnosis process finished.


# Goal
The biggest social problem of medical in China is the exorbitant cost of medical treatment and difficulty to see a good doctor. 

Patients in China would only like to go to big hospitals, because the medical level is higher, where patients need to wait in the long line for more than 2 hours to diagnose a small cold. While it is almost empty in community hospital, especially in big city. Making the medical cost in top hospitals in big city much higher than small hospitals.

However, there is an idea. If all big hospitals and small hospitals could be connected together, with the cloud technology and remote telemedicine. No matter where you go (small or big hospitals), the medical treatment is the same. Then patients no longer need to crowd into the big hospitals to pay the high costs. 

Here, we get the solution: cloud technology and remote telemedicine.

Using our software, what doctors in small hospital only need to do is wearing the devices for patients, all diagnosis would be achieved by algorithm. Finally the doctor in big hospital only need to check the diagnosis if it is valid, and the diagnosis report would be recognized by big hospital. No matter patients choose(big hospital or small hospital), the report is the same.(all recognized by top hospitals)

Now we have achieved the blood pressure remote diagnosis by employed our this software to hospitals, we believe the similar technology would also be helpful in other disease treatment as well as other countris in the world.(Just think, doctors in Africa send diagnosis report to America.).
